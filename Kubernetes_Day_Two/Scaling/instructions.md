1. Log into the Azure portal
2. Go to your AKS cluster
3. Go to Node Pools
4. Click Scale Node Pool

If you didn't already set up scaling when you created the cluster, you'll see two options:
1. Manual scale
2. Auto scale

Back in the day, I would say to manually scale based on needs. Now, with the efficiency of not only the cloud, but how accurate it is at scaling up and scaling down based on resource needs, I always recommend to just turn on autoscaling.
